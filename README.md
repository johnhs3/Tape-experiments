# Tape_stuff
Experiments for going between audio casette tape and digital data.

Right now this uses an old program for DOS, which uses the Kansas City Standard to encode and decode to DAT drives.
The goal is to:
1.) first, understand what's going on / find a setup which gets consistent, good results
2.) Create a program (in C, maybe?) which is equivalent to KCS08.exe, but for x86 machines.
3.) GRAND GOAL: Figure out how to encorporate something like this into the wider "Architecture"...
